''' 

Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (ax1, ay1) and its top-right corner (ax2, ay2).

The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (bx1, by1) and its top-right corner (bx2, by2).

        # Compute the area of the two rectangles
        area1 = (ax2 - ax1) * (ay2 - ay1)
        area2 = (bx2 - bx1) * (by2 - by1)
        
        # Compute the overlap area
        overlapWidth = min(ax2, bx2) - max(ax1, bx1)
        overlapHeight = min(ay2, by2) - max(ay1, by1)
        overlapArea = max(overlapWidth, 0) * max(overlapHeight, 0)

        totalArea = area1 + area2 - overlapArea
