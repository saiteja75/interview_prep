A string is a sequence of characters it is similar to Arrays

all the techniques of arrays are applicable for strings as well

Types:
    -substring: continous character from string
    -subsequence: not continous characters from string

Looking up in strings:(way of arranging the collection of strings)
1. Trie/Prefix Tree -
    If two strings have a common prefix then they will have the same ancestor in the trie. A trie can be used to sort a collection of strings alphabetically as well as search 
    whether a string with a given prefix is present in the trie or not.
2. Suffix Tree
    All the suffixes of a string and each suffix will end with special character


Techniques to use in strings:

1. Counting Characters:
    - Creating the count array(Of size 26) and Count the frequency of characters in a string. 

2. Anagram:
    - An anagram is word switch or word play. It is the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, while using all the original letters only once

    Ways to determine if the given strings are anagrams are not?
    - Sort both the strings and check whether both are equal or not O(nlogn)
    - Create a hash with the character frequency of the two strings and compare whether they both have same data or not
    - Assign a prime number to each character and compute the value of the string by mulitpying in assigned prime number and check the multipier for the strings 

3. Palindrome:
    - A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward eg madam
    
    Ways to determine if the given string are palindrome or not?
    - Revere the given string and compare original string and reverse string is equal or not. if equal then its a palindrome
    - Two Pointers one from start and other from end, start comparing start value and end value and move Pointers 
      respective pointer. if any point of time if the values won't match then it is not a palindrome
