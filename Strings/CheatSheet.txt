A string is a sequence of characters it is similar to Arrays

all the techniques of arrays are applicable for strings as well

Looking up in strings:(way of arranging the collection of strings)
1. Trie/Prefix Tree -
    If two strings have a common prefix then they will have the same ancestor in the trie. A trie can be used to sort a collection of strings alphabetically as well as search 
    whether a string with a given prefix is present in the trie or not.
2. Suffix Tree
    All the suffixes of a string and each suffix will end with special character


Techniques to use in strings:

1. Counting Characters:
    - Creating the count array(Of size 26) and Count the frequency of characters in a string. 

2. Anagram:
    - An anagram is word switch or word play. It is the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, while using all the original letters only once

    Ways to determine if the given strings are anagrams are not?
    - Sort both the strings and check whether both are equal or not O(nlogn)
    - Create a hash with the character frequency of the two strings and compare whether they both have same data or not
