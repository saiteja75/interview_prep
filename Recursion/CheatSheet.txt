Recursion:

Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

All recursive functions contains two parts:

1. A base case (or cases) defined, which defines when the recursion is stopped - otherwise it will go on forever!

2. Breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and invoking the recursive call
