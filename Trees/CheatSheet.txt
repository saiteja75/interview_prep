Trees:
-> It is Non-Linear Data Structure
-> It Represents hierarchial structure with connected node

Types of Trees:
-> binary tree: each parent node can connect to atmost 2 child nodes
-> ternary Trees
-> N-array Trees
-> binary search Trees

Tree Traversal Technique:
1. In-order traversal - Left -> Root -> Right
2. Pre-order traversal - Root -> Left -> Right
3. Post-order traversal - Left -> Right -> Root

Binary Search Tree:
1. all the node values left to the root node should be less than it
2. all the node values right to the root node should be greater than it

Techniques:
1. Recursion
2. Traversing By Level: Breadth first search
3. Summation of nodes
