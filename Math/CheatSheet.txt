Common Formulas:

1. Check if a number is even
        num % 2 == 0
        ! n & 1

2. Sum of 1 to N
        n*(n+1)//2

3. Sum of Geometric Progression
        2^(n+1) - 1

4. Permutations of N
        n!/(n-r)!

5. Combinations of N
        n!/r!(n-r)!


Techniques

1. Multiples of a number:
    When a question involves "whether a number is a multiple of X", the modulo operator would be useful.

2. Fast operators
    If the question asks you to implement an operator such as power, square root or division and 
    want it to be faster than O(n), some sort of doubling (fast exponentiation) or halving (binary search) 
    is usually the approach to go
