Arrays are ways to store elements in contiguous memory locations.

Advantages:
1. Store multiple elements in a single variable
2. Accessing would be easier as it is index based.

Disadvantages:
1. Adding and removing elements in middle would be difficult as we need to move rest of the elements into it corresponding locations

Common terms:

Subarray -
 A range of contiguous values within an array.
    Example: given an array [2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 4], [3, 6, 1] is a subarray while [3, 1, 5] is not a subarray.
Subsequence - 
 A sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
    Example: given an array [2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 4], [3, 1, 5] is a subsequence but [3, 5, 1] is not a subsequence.
