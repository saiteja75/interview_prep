Arrays are ways to store elements in contiguous memory locations.

Advantages:
1. Store multiple elements in a single variable
2. Accessing would be easier as it is index based.

Disadvantages:
1. Adding and removing elements in middle would be difficult as we need to move rest of the elements into it corresponding locations

Common terms:

Subarray -
 A range of contiguous values within an array.
    Example: given an array [2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 4], [3, 6, 1] is a subarray while [3, 1, 5] is not a subarray.
Subsequence - 
 A sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
    Example: given an array [2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 4], [3, 1, 5] is a subsequence but [3, 5, 1] is not a subsequence.

Techniques to use in arrays:

1. Sliding Window 
    - Refer Techniques folder for more info
2. Two pointers 
    - Two pointers is a more general version of sliding window where the pointers can cross each other and can be on different arrays. 
    - Moving of the two pointers would be based on the problem criteria 
3. Traversing from Right
    - Sometimes you can traverse the array starting from the right instead of the conventional approach of from the left
