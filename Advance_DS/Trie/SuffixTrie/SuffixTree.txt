What is suffix tree?
suffix tree is collection of strings and compression version of trie.

There are many ways to construct a suffix tree, but the semantics that is shared by most if not all types of suffix trees are as follows:

1. A special character is appended to each sub-string.
2. Each leaf node contains the starting position or index of the suffix it represents.
3. The alphabets of any suffix are compressed and represented by a single node.

- each unique suffix in the list is compressed together in a suffix tree.

We can implement suffix trie using Ukkonen's Algorithm
