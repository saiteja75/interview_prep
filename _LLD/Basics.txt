-> LLD or low-level design is a component-level design process that follows step by step refinement process.

-> In this Process we understand the finalized requirements and then design the components (objects) and then define 
   the interactions between the components.

-> Drawing the Class Diagrams will be helpful for better understanding the follows

Class Diagrams Contains
-> Classes
-> Relations

Classes Contains:
-> properties
-> methods

ROAD MAP FOR LLD:

1. OOPs (Object Oriented Principles)
2. Process of analyzing and designing (relating real things into objects)
3. Design Patterns
4. UML Diagrams
5. SOLID Principles
