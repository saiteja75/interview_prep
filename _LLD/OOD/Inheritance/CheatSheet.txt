Inheritance:
-> this is Principle is about getting a entity properties and methods from another entity
->  It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.

Real-World Examples:
-> The class 'Car' inherits its properties from the class 'Automobiles' which inherits some of its properties from another class 'Vehicles'

-> All animals have common properties, so all animals will inherit the basic properties and each animal have some unique properties
