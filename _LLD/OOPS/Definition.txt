Principles of OOP
The following are the four principles of object-oriented programming:

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Encapsulation:
-> This is the principle to hide the data which is not required by the end user and only need for internal purpose
-> Its like preventing from unauthorized accessible
-> Class in OOProgramming is a example
-> It protects your classes from accidental changes or deletions and promotes code reusability and maintainability.
-> There are 3 different access specifiers which defines the level of access
    1. public - any one can access this methods or properties
    2. protected - methods or properties which are protected can only be accessed within itself and those which are created from them (inheritence)
    3. private - methods or properties which are private can only be accessed within itself and no other external things can access these
