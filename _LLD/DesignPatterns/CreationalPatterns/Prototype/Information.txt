Prototype Pattern:
-> It is creational design pattern
-> This pattern lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent 
on their classes.
-> General Approach of creating a object of same class and copying the values from object
might not be correct because all the private variables are not copied

When to use Prototype Pattern:
-> Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.
