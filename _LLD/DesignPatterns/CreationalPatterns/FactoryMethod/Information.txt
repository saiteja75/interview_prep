Factory Method Pattern:
-> it is structural patterns
-> Creating properties and method in super class and overwritting/alter the properties and method in
child class

Factory Method solves below problem:
-> if you want to use the same functionality to multiple usecase we use this pattern to create 
a factory class which will be extended by the child classes and override the necessary methods


When to use factory method:
-> Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and 
dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
-> Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or 
framework with a way to extend its internal components.
-> Use the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by reusing 
existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.

Advantages:
-> We are not tightly coupling the creator and concreta classes
-> Follows Single Responsibility Principle
-> Follows Open/Closed Principle
