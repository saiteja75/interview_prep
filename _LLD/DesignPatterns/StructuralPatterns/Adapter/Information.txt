Adapter Pattern:
-> This is Structural pattern
-> This pattern allows object with incompatible interfaces to collaborate
-> Adapter is a special object that converts the interface of one object so that another object can understand it.
-> This is similar to power plug adapter socket.

Usecases:
-> When an application want to use other libraries by integrating but that data accepted by other
libraries might be different from the data present in your application. In this cases 
you can use Adapter pattern
-> Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, 
but its interface isnâ€™t compatible with the rest of your code.

How it is implemented?
-> Adapter Object is created where it accepts application understanding interface and converts
it into 3rd party understanding libraries interface

Follows:
-> Single Responsibility Principle
-> Open/Closed Principle
