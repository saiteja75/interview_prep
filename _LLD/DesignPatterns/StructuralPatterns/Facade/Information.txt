Facade Pattern:
-> It is Structural Pattern
-> It provides a simplified interface to a libraries/framework or complex set of classes
-> One Facade can use another facade

When to apply facade pattern:
-> Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
-> Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.
-> Use the facade pattern when you want to execute some step in a order every time when you want to use that particular service

Real world Example
-> when you order an item through sales person (he is facede), sales person takes care of all the internal process
