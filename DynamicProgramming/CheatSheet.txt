Dynamic Programming:
-> Dynamic Programming (DP) is usually used to solve optimization problems.

-> Dynamic programming amounts to breaking down an optimization problem into simpler sub-problems, 
   and storing the solution to each sub-problem so that each sub-problem is only solved once.

Sub-Problem:
Sub-problems are smaller versions of the original problem. In fact, sub-problems often look like a reworded version of the original problem. 
If formulated correctly, sub-problems build on each other in order to obtain the solution to the original problem.

When to use DP?

-> When problem indicates maximum or minimum solution given certain constraints

Steps to solve DP:
-> Identify the sub-problem 
-> Solve the sub-problem
-> store the value and re-use when required

Dynamic Programming Approaches:
-> Top-down Approach: 
    we solve the large problem by breaking it into smaller problem

-> Bottom-up Approach:
    start with smaller problem and build each solution to reach larger problem.Space complexity can be saved by using this approach
