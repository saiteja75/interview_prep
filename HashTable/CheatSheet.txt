HashTable:
-> It is a datastructue with maps a key with a value where key is computed based on a hash function(which make unique value)

-> Hashing is the most common example of a space-time tradeoff. Instead of linearly searching an array 
   every time to determine if an element is present, which takes O(n) time, 
   we can traverse the array once and hash all the elements into a hash table. 
   Determining if the element is present is a simple matter of hashing the element and seeing if it 
   exists in the hash table, which is O(1) on average

Possible ways to overcome of collision in key:
-> Optional Chaining: adding all the values in the same key
-> Open addressing: finding next empty slot to store the value
