LinkedList
1. a linked list is used to represent sequential data
2. data is stored in sequential blocks of memory. Instead, each element contains an address of the next element. 
3. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

Advantage:

1. Insertion and Deletion is O(1) complexity

Disadvantage:

1. Accessing a element is linear time complexity i.e O(n)


Techniques:

1. Dummy Node
2. Two Pointers
3. Space (new LinkedList)
4. Modification
