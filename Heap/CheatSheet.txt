HEAP:
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is a complete tree that satisfies the heap property.

Max heap - In a max heap, the value of a node must be greatest among the node values in its entire subtree. 
The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in the tree.

Min heap - In a min heap, the value of a node must be smallest among the node values in its entire subtree. 
The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in the tree.

Mention of K:
If you see a top or lowest k being mentioned in the question, it is usually a signal that a heap can be used to solve the problem,
