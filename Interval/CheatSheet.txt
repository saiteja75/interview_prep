Intervals:
Interval questions are a subset of array questions where you are given an array of two-element arrays (an interval) 
and the two values represent a start and an end value.

Techniques:

-> Sort the array of intervals by its starting point
-> Checking if two intervals overlap
-> Merging two intervals
