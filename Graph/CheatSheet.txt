Graph:
-> A graph is a structure containing a set of objects (nodes or vertices) where there can be edges 
  between these nodes/vertices. Edges can be directed or undirected and can optionally have values (a weighted graph). 
  
-> Trees are undirected graphs in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one edge and there can be no cycles in the graph.

-> A Single node can be considered as graph and usually referred to as a singleton graph

-> G(V,E)
Types of Graph:

-> Directed Graph - Edges with direction
-> Undirected Graph - Edges without direction

UseCases of Graph:
1. Friendship between people:
    -> people: nodes/vertices
    -> Friendship: edges

2. Distances between locations:
    -> locations: nodes/vertices
    -> Distances: edges
